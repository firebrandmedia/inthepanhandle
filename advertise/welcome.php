<h2>Ready to get started with Internet Advertising?</h2>
<p>InThePanhandle.com is the premier, local online advertising venue. We offer the best opportunity for you to grow your business, not only locally but online. That's a big market.  Trust us, we've looked.</p>
<p>So, why do we say that InThePanhandle.com is your best local, online advertising choice? More importantly, why do we <i>believe</i> that? Here's why…</p>
<div class="why_advertise">
<h2>1. Local Content</h2>
<p> Some sites advertise themselves as being local, but when you browse the site you see content that is really not local. You'll find news from the AP, ads from Google, video from YouTube… that's cool, we love <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoCqvnJFUUA">YouTube</a> as much as anyone.  But, it's not local. It has been scraped or pulled from various other sites to attract an audience. </p>
<p>When we say local, we mean local.  Our content, <i>the stuff you come to InThePanhandle.com for</i>, pertains to three counties here in Eastern West Virginia*.  Our content creators, like our content, are local.  Do we have opinions, stories, articles and polls that reach further than the Eastern Panhandle? Of course.  Is what happens here important to people outside of the Eastern Panhandle? Of course, that's why we get visitors from around the world and our advertisers (and their products) reach people around the world.</p>

<h2>2. Local Ads</h2>
<p>Another issue with most local sites is that not only are you competing with the local advertisers, but you're also competing with Google and their ad network.</p>
<p><i>You know, the 800LB gorilla of advertising?</i> InThePanhandle.com no longer displays ads from non-local advertisers.  (<b>note</b> - The previous version of InThePanhandle.com did use Google Ads as a source of revenue.  But it's not what customers wanted and so we axed it. Take that Google Ads! But please don't drop our search engine rank.)</p>
<p>You won't find any kind of banner exchanges or ad networks on our site.  So, you no longer have to worry about competing with internet advertisers who low-ball you on price (while charging exorbitant shipping rates).</p>
</div>
<div class="why_advertise">
<h2>3. Growable Ad Choices</h2>
<p><i>Growable</i> may not be a word, but the concept applies.  We've created various packages to meet the needs of advertisers large and small. </p>
<p>I know what your thinking, <i>"That sounds like your talking about ad dollars and budget"</i>, but we're really not.  We feel that any / all of our advertising packages can be used and useful to businesses of all sizes, with objectives large and small.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the main reasons to advertise on InThePanhandle.com.  Other reasons include: <b>affordability</b> - Ads start at $10 per month, <b>flexibility</b> - Make changes to your ad on a moments notice, <b>statistics</b> that will keep you on top of your advertising investment.

<div class="continue"><p><b>Small, medium or large, we have an ad package for you. </b> <a href="{path='SITE_INDEX'}/advertise/compare_temporary/"> Advertising Packages &#8594;</a></p></div>
<p class="having_trouble">*We do have one page that is not generated locally and that is our <a href="{path='SITE_INDEX'}/news/" title="InThePanhandle.com News, not totally local">news page</a>.  There is a 1000px x 500px section at the bottom of that page that pulls news, some of it of local interest, for those that want a one stop shop for news, or to get caught up.</p>
